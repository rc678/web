sets. This title made him the only British male to become a Grand Slam singles champion 
during the Open Era. Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships,to become the

and the US Open in the same calendar year, as well as the third man to hold the 
Gold Medal and win two majors on different surfaces. Murray has been the runner-up 
in seven other singles Grand Slam finals: the 2008 US Open, the 2010, 2011, 2013, 
2015 and 2016 Australian Opens, and the 2012 Wimbledon Championships. He is the 
first man in the open era to achieve five runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, 
after losing to Djokovic in the final of the 2016 Australian Open. In 2011, Murray
